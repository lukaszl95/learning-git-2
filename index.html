		<p>Last Christmas<br>

		I'll give it to someone special</p>
		<p>Last Christmas <br>
		I gave you my heart <br>
		But the very next day <br>
		You gave it away (you gave it away)<br>
		This year <br>
		To save me from tears <br>
		I'll give it to someone special (special)</p>
		<p>Once bitten and twice shy <br>
		I keep my distance <br>
		But you still catch my eye <br>
		Tell me baby <br>
		Do you recognize me? <br>
		Well <br>
		It's been a year <br>
		It doesn't surprise me </p>
